create style.css file
create a content.json file (I don't quite understand what it should be, but so that the search, categories and admin panel work in the future)
create script.js (again I don't know why, but so that articles are loaded from content.json, categories are working, search is working and connects everything....well, or whatever else is needed)
if possible create admin.html (well in the future I'll upload it to netlify and I want an admin panel so that there would be a plus sign and it would be easier to add articles. so that articles would be added to content.json)

I already have a website: index.html, article.html, style.css, script.js, content.json.
I want to be able to add new articles via the admin panel with the "+" button, without manually editing the code and JSON.
To do this, please add to the project:
1. The /admin/ folder, and in it:
index.html — the login page for the admin panel.
config.yml — Netlify (Decap) CMS configuration with the "articles" collection settings (fields: title, description, category, text, image, slug, etc., whatever else we have). 2. Set it up so that articles from the admin panel are saved in content.json (or another file, if necessary).
So that after uploading to Netlify, I can open site.com/admin, click "+", fill out the form and the new article will immediately appear on the site.
Now I need to update your existing files to integrate with the CMS. Let me modify your index.html to include the admin link: these are your words, if you need to update something, do it. if not, then don't change anything
Update my Netlify CMS files. I need content.json and admin/config.yml to support these fields for each article: id, title, slug, author, date, category, description, image, content. So that you can fill all this in the admin panel, and it will be saved in content.json.

I currently have a static site with Netlify CMS. I need to get everything to work.
1. Leave the admin/index.html file as is — it's already correct.
2. For some reason, the admin/config.yml file is now in HTML format, but it should be YAML. Fix it: insert a clean YAML configuration there (without <html>, <head>, etc.), something like this: backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: main
media_folder: "static/images"
public_folder: "/images"

collections:
  - name: "articles"
    label: "Articles"
    folder: "/"
    extension: "json"
    format: "json"
    create: true
    slug: "{{slug}}"
    fields:
      - { label: "ID", name: "id", widget: "number" }
      - { label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string" }
      - { label: "Slug", name: "slug", widget: "string" }
      - { label: "Author", name: "author", widget: "string" }
      - { label: "Publish Date", name: "date", widget: "datetime" }
      - { label: "Category", name: "category", widget: "select", options: ["books", "films", "anime", "games"] }
      - { label: "Description", name: "description", widget: "text" }
      - { label: "Featured Image", name: "image", widget: "image" }
      - { label: "Content", name: "content", widget: "markdown" } 3. The content.json file needs to be standardized. Currently, only the first article contains the author, date, and content fields. Make it so that all articles have the same fields: id
title
slug
author
date
category
description
image
content In the content.json example, for those articles where there is no author and content, you can substitute placeholders: author: "Unknown"
date: current date in ISO format
content: "..."  As a result, I want:
/admin/ to open a normal Netlify CMS panel,
when adding a new article, it is saved in content.json with the required fields,
old articles are brought to the same format.
